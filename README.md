# LICKD

## Price Calculator Challenge

### Setup & Installing

To set this project up you will need to first clone this repository.

You will also need `php` available on your computer via the command line.

To get this project up and running you will also need the `composer` package
manager. You can download composer [here](https://getcomposer.org/).

The following commands should get you up and running;

```
git clone git@github.com:hookdteam/lickd-price-calculator-test.git
cd ./lickd-price-calculator-test
composer install
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/ #to confirm tests are working
php ./console #entry point to your command
```

### Application

This simple PHP project has been configured with the `symfony/console` package
and has a console command ready to take command line input. See `app/Console/PriceCalculatorConsole.php`.

If you are unfamiliar with the `symfony/console` package see the [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/console.html).

### Testing

We have also gone to the effort of installing and bootstrapping `phpunit` inside
this project. To run your unit tests you can run `php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/`.

## The Challenge

We have provided CSV exports of the latest video uploads by various YouTube Creators inside the `data/` directory.

Each CSV file contains the channel id, video id, video title and video views.

### Part 1

Taking a `channelId` parameter from the command line we want you to calculate the average
video views across their latest 50 uploads. We also require that you remove the outlier
videos that have done either exceptionally well or poorly in terms of video views.
Therefore you **should remove the lower 5th percentile and upper 5th percentile** videos
from your calculation.

### Part 2

Once you have the average video views across their latest video uploads you should put the channel into a
price band as detailed in the table below.

#### Standard Price

| Average Views | Price |
|---------------|-------|
| 0     - 100k  | £10   |
| 100k  - 500k  | £20   |
| 500k  - 1m    | £30   |
| 1m    - 1.25m | £35   |
| 1.25m - 1.5m  | £40   |
| 1.5m  - 1.75m | £45   |
| 1.75m - 2m    | £50   |
| 2m+           | £60   |

#### Brand Pricing

| Average Views | Price |
|---------------|-------|
| 0     - 1m    | £25   |
| 1m    - 1.25m | £75   |
| 1.25m - 1.5m  | £125  |
| 1.5m  - 1.75m | £165  |
| 1.75m - 2m    | £200  |
| 2m+           | £250  |

Your application should respond as follows:

```
php ./console.php price:calculator UCWRV5AVOlKJR1Flvgt310Cw

```


### Testing
